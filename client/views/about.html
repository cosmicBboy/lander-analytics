  <h3>Howard Lander, Managing Director & GM</h3>
  <p>Howard Lander spent his entire career in the publishing and information industry, steadily rising from the editorial ranks to his final position as Chief Operating Officer of VNU Business Media, Inc. The company’s operations included more than 60 business-to-business publications as well as over 100 trade shows and conferences. Mr. Lander started with BPI Communications as a reporter and then worked several years in advertising sales. In 1990 he was named Publisher of Billboard Magazine, where he lead the conversion of its world famous music charts from simple phone surveys to more advanced analytics. Retail rankings became based on an industry first electronically captured point-of-sales system. During the same period, airplay charts adopted a new technology utilizing automatic song recognition that monitored thousands of radio stations throughout the country. Mr. Lander was instrumental in VNU’s 1999 acquisition of the United Kingdom’s data collection and cataloging system for the book publishing industry with the purchase of the Whitaker Company and was given the added responsibility of Business Media’s worldwide Literary Group. His promotion to Chief Operating Officer occurred in 2001. In 1991, Mr. Lander was a partner in the purchase of majority ownership of BPI Communications from the New York Times Co. The company was sold to Holland based VNU (now the Nielsen Co.) three years later, where he remained until 2006, when the international conglomerate was taken private by a consortium of six equity firms led by the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts.  He was named one of the 100 most influential music industry executives by BAM Magazine. In 1998 he received the prestigious Spirit of Life Award from the music chapter of the City of Hope in Los Angeles.</p>
